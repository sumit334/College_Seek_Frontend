                <Text variant="h5">I'm a pre-final year student at Jadavpur University, specializing in Information Technology.
                    I'm an avid learner with hands-on experience in website development and project implementation.<br />
                    I am a highly motivated and results-driven professional with a robust background in Data 
                    Structures and Algorithms (DSA). My true passion lies in the realm of Web Development, 
                    where I am recognized for my meticulous attention to detail, outstanding problem-solving skills, 
                    and effective communication abilities. In the vast landscape of programming languages, I wield 
                    JAVA with expertise.<br />
                    I am not just a developer; I am a perpetual learner, always poised to embrace new challenges 
                    and technologies. My commitment to continuous growth fuels my adaptability and quick learning.
                    <br />
                    Beyond the coding world, I harbor a keen interest in the Finance sector. I am not only a 
                    coder but also a dedicated Web Developer based in India. <br />
                    I specialize in crafting dynamic and interactive digital experiences using the powerful
                    MERN stack â€” combining React.js for front-end brilliance, Node.js and Express.js for
                    robust server-side applications, and MongoDB for seamless database management. As a MERN
                    Stack Developer, I am dedicated to creating sophisticated and user-centric solutions that
                    seamlessly blend creativity with cutting-edge technology.
